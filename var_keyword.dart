  /**
  var keyword in dart programming

  var is a keyword, that means "I don't care to notate what the type is here".
  var a = "ved";

  simply dart will replace the var keyword with initializer type or leave it dynamic by default if there is no initailizer
  
  eg.
  var a;

  var keyword can't change the data type if initialized for first time but can change the value later
